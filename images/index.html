            <h2>Misconceptions about space</h2>

            <p>One of the most common misconceptions about space is that it is a vacuum and there is no air present.
                However, space is not a vacuum and there is a small amount of gas and dust present. Another
                misconception is that stars are only visible at night. In reality, stars can be seen during the day, but
                they are not as visible because of the bright sunlight. Another misconception is that the Earth is flat,
                but it is actually an oblate spheroid, meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the
                equator. Another misconception is that all planets are similar in size and composition, but in reality,
                planets can vary greatly in size, composition, and atmosphere. Finally, another misconception is that
                space is completely silent, however, there are many sounds in space such as the radio waves emitted by
                stars and planets, but they are not audible to the human ear.</p>

            <h2>Crazy space facts</h2>
            <p>The fastest human-made object is the Parker Solar Probe, which was launched in 2018 and is currently
                traveling at a speed of <em>213,200 miles per hour</em> (343,000 km/h) as it approaches the sun. The
                universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old, and it is still expanding at a rate of
                approximately 74.3 miles per second per megaparsec.

        <h2>Space conspiracy theories</h2>
        <p>One of the most popular space conspiracy theories is that <strong>United States government and NASA have been
                actively covering up the existence of UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</strong> This theory suggests that
            the
            government has been hiding evidence of UFOs and alien encounters, and that NASA has been altering or
            suppressing images and footage of UFOs captured by satellites and telescopes. Some conspiracy theorists also
            believe that the government has been working with extraterrestrial beings and has been covering up the
            existence of secret bases on the moon and Mars. This theory is often tied in with the idea that there is a
            secret cabal of government and corporate figures who are controlling the information released to the public
            about space and UFOs, and that they are doing so in order to maintain control and power over the population.
